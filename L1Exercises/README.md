### Exercise 1.4

A certain bank offers 6.5% interest on savings accounts, compounded annually. 
Create a table that shows how much money a person will accumulate over 
a period of 25 years, assuming that the person makes an 
initial investment of $1000 and deposits $100 each year 
after the first. Your table should indicate for each year the 
current balance, the interest, the new deposit, and the new 
balance. The output of the program should like something 
like this:
